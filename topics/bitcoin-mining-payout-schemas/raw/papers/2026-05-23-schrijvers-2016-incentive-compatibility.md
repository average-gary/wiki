# Incentive Compatibility of Bitcoin Mining Pool Reward Functions (Schrijvers et al. FC'16)

Formal mechanism-design counterpart to Rosenfeld 2011. Reframes pool reward design as a mechanism-design problem: which reward functions make truthful share submission a Nash equilibrium?

## Definitions

**Incentive compatibility (IC)** for a pool reward function: every miner truthfully reporting every share they find (no block withholding) is a Nash equilibrium given the reward function and the strategies of all other miners.

## Key results

- **Proportional is NOT incentive compatible.** Miners can profit by withholding full blocks under proportional payout.
- **PPS is IC** but at high cost to operator (variance-bearing → reserve requirement).
- **PPLNS is IC only under specific parameter regimes.** Compatibility depends on the window size N relative to round length. Small-N PPLNS approaches proportional and loses IC.
- **Authors construct a novel IC reward function** that preserves miners' steady-payout property while remaining provably IC.

## Implications for modern schemes

- **TIDES** (8× difficulty window) sits in a regime where N is large relative to round length → likely IC, but no formal proof in TIDES doc.
- **PPLNS-JD / SLICE** inherits PPLNS's IC parameter sensitivity.
- **eHash / hashpool** — IC analysis is open; bearer-token issuance changes the game-theoretic surface (the share *is* the reward, not a claim against future reward).

## Why it matters for this wiki

Pairs with Rosenfeld (intra-pool variance) and Eyal "Miner's Dilemma" (inter-pool BWH) to give the full game-theoretic frame: a payout scheme must be variance-tolerable AND IC AND robust to inter-pool sabotage. Few schemes satisfy all three.
